US Elections Results: Donald Trump has won the US elections, winning a landslide victory in swing states. His rival Kamala Harris has secured 226 electoral colleges, while Trump has won 295â€”crossing the majority mark of 270. He will be the second Republican to get a second term in office in 20 years. George Bush, a Republican, was president from 2001 to 2009. 

As far as swing states are concerned, Trump has already won the swing states of Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and is leading in the other two - Arizona, and Nevada.

Kamala Harris conceded defeat early morning. In her speech, the Democratic leader said though she has conceded the election, she has not conceded "the fight that fuelled this campaign."
